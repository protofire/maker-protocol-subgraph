### Dai Module:

### Core Module

#### Vault Engine (vat)

**handleGrab:** Vault liquidation

>function grab(bytes32 i, address u, address v, address w, int dink, int dart)

_It's also referred as "*CDP Confiscation*"_

This function is executed by the Liquidation module through the "Bark method" and modifies following entities:

1. User: the user is created with the urnAddress<function param arg2 "u">

2. User: the liquidator is created with the  liquidatorAddress<function param arg3 "v">

3. CollateralType: the ilk is loaded with the ilkAddress<function param arg1 "i"> and modified as follows:
	- the "debtNormalized" attr<art> is decreased by adding the "dart" value (negative signed float number)

			ilk.Art = _add(ilk.Art, dart); // vat.sol ln213


	- the "totalDebt" attr<dtab> ir re calculated by multipliying the "debtNormalized" times the 
	"colalteralType's rate"

			int dtab = _mul(ilk.rate, dart); // vat.sol ln215

4. Vault: the urn is loaded with the urnAddress<function param arg2 "u"> and modified as follows:

	- the "collateral" attr<ink> is decreased by adding the "dink" value (negative signed float number)

			urn.ink = _add(urn.ink, dink); // vat.sol ln211

	- the "debt" attr<art> is decreased by adding the "dart" value (negative signed float number)
			
			urn.art = _add(urn.art, dart); // vat.sol ln212

5. Collateral: the gem is created or loaded with the composition of the CollateralType ilkAddress<function param arg1 "i"> and the User liquidatorAddress<function param arg3 "v">

	- the "amount" is increased by substracting the "dink" value (negative signed float number)
		
			gem[i][v] = _sub(gem[i][v], dink); // vat.sol ln217

6. SystemDebt: the sin is created or loaded with the vowAddres<function param arg3 "w">

	- the "amount" is increased by substracting the "dtab" value (negative signed float number)
	
			sin[w]    = _sub(sin[w],    dtab); // vat.sol ln218

7. SystemState: the systemState is loaded with it's singleton id.

	-	the "totalSystemDebt" attr<vice> is increased by substracting the "dtab" value (negative signed float number)

			vice      = _sub(vice,      dtab); // vat.sol ln219


**handleInit:** CollateralType registration

> function init(bytes32 ilk)

This function modifies the following entities:

- CollateralType: It is created with the ilk<function param arg1 "ilk"> and modified as follows:
  
  - the "rate" attr<rate> is set to 1 in RAY format

    ilks[ilk].rate = 10 ** 27;

  - the "auctionDuration" attr<auctionDuration> is set to 2 days
  - the "bidDuration" attr<bidDuration> is set to 3 hours
  - the "minimumBidIncrease" attr<minimumBidIncrease> is set to 1.05, 5% minimum bid increase

- SystemState:
  - the "collateralCount" is increased by 1


**handleFrob:** Vault creation / modification

> function frob(bytes32 i, address u, address v, address w, int dink, int dart)

Modified entities:

  - Vault
    - "collateralType"
    - "collateral"
    - "debt"
    - "handler"
    - "owner"
  - CollateralType
    - "unmanagedVaultCount"
    - "totalCollateral"
    - "debtNormalized"
    - "totalDebt"
  - User
    - "vaultCount"
  - SystemState
    - "unmanagedVaultCount"
  - VaultCreationLog
    - "vault"

    - "collateralDiff"
  - VaultDebtChangeLog
    - "vault"
    - "debtBefore"
    - "debtAfter"
    - "debtDiff"

**handleFile:** CollateralType updates

This mapping handles 2 contract functions with the same name but different params by the use of an anonymous event that has a signature hash that depends on the params provided. We use this signature hash to split the logic for each contract function.

> function file(bytes32 what, uint data)

> function file(bytes32 ilk, bytes32 what, uint data)

If the signature matches the first function and the `what` param is "Line" then it updates the `totalDebtCeiling` on the `SystemState` Entity.
In the other hand if the signature matches the second function, we use the `ilk` param to load the `CollateralType` then we look at the `what` param to know what to update. ("line" means `Debt Ceiling` while "dust" means `Debt Floor`)

Entities modified:

- SystemState
  - the "totalDebtCeiling" attr<totalDebtCeiling> is updated with the data <function param arg2 "data">

      if (what == "Line") Line = data;

- CollateralType: 
It is loaded from the ilk <function param arg1 "ilk"> and modified as follows:
  - the "debtCeiling" attr<debtCeiling> is updated with the data <function param arg2 "data">

      > else if (what == "line") ilks[ilk].line = data;

  - the "vaultDebtFloor" attr<vaultDebtFloor> is updated with the data <function param arg2 "data">

      > else if (what == "dust") ilks[ilk].dust = data;

**handleSlip:** Modify a user's collateral balance

> function slip(bytes32 ilk, address usr, int256 wad)

This function is executed e.g. by the join contract and modifies a user's collateral balance. It creates or modifies the following entity:

1. Collateral: It loads or creates a collateral <function param arg1 "ilk"> for a certain user <function param arg2 "usr">

    - The field amount is increased or decreased by adding <function param arg3 "wad"> (as wad)

      > gem[ilk][usr] = add(gem[ilk][usr], wad);


**handleMove:** Transfer Stablecoin

> function move(address src, address dst, uint256 rad)

This function moves the DAI Stablecoin from address to another. It modifies or creates the following entities:

1. User: It loads the user with the src <function param arg1 "src"> address.

    - The field DAI is decreased by substracting the <function param arg3 "rad"> (as wad) from the DAI field.

      > dai[src] = _sub(dai[src], rad);

2. User: It loads the user with the dst <function param arg2 "dst"> address and adds the.
