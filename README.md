## Description

This subgraph aims to track the status of the Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD) through multiple contracts.

---

## Data sources

### Core Module:

> The Core Module is crucial to the system as it contains the entire state of the Maker Protocol and controls the central mechanisms of the system while it is in the expected normal state of operation.

#### Vault Engine (Vat)

> fill me with the description of the contract

##### handleInit

```
function init(bytes32 ilk)
```

Creates new _CollateralType_

Update the following entities:

- _CollateralType_
- _SystemState_

The _handleInit_ mapper function receives 1 parameter.

We pick the _collateralTypeId_ from the _arg1_ then we create the _CollateralType_ record with some default values. Also, we track the _collateralType_ quantity by increasing the field _collateralCount_ on _SystemState_.

##### handleFile

```
function file(bytes32 what, uint data)

function file(bytes32 ilk, bytes32 what, uint data)
```

Updates _CollateralType_ and _SystemState_

- _SystemState_.totalDebtCeiling
- _CollateralType_.debtCeiling
- _CollateralType_.vaultDebtFloor

The _handleFile_ mapper function receives a _LogNote_ event as parameter. This handler processes 2 contract functions with the same name _file_ but different arity. We use the _signature_ parameter to split the logic for those contract functions.

##### handleCage

- _DaiMoveLog_.dst

The _handleMove_ mapper function receives a _LogNote_ event as parameter. We receive 3 parameters; _src_ (source User), _dst_ (destination User) and the _rad_ (the amount of stablecoin) to transfer.

function fork(bytes32 ilk, address src, address dst, int dink, int dart)
```

Split a Vault

- _Vault_
- _VaultSplitChangeLog_

The _handleFork_ function receives 5 parameters; _ilk_, _src_, _dst_, _dink_, _dart_
